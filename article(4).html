        <h3>Early Computers</h3>
        <p>The earliest electronic computers, developed in the <b>1940s</b>, were massive machines that occupied entire rooms. They relied on thousands of vacuum tubes to process data, which generated immense heat and were prone to failure. <u> Programs were input using punched cards or paper tape, and their processing power was minuscule compared to today's devices.</u> These giants, like the <mark><small>ENIAC</small></mark>, were primarily built for specific military and scientific calculations. The <b>1950s</b> saw the transition from vacuum tubes to more reliable transistors, marking the dawn of computing's second generation.</p>

        <h3>Generations of Computers</h3>
        <p>The first generation of computers used vacuum tubes, were enormous in size, and required significant amounts of electricity. <i>The second generation replaced tubes with transistors, making computers smaller, more reliable, and more energy-efficient. Third-generation computers utilized integrated circuits <b>(ICs)</b>, which further miniaturized components and drastically increased processing speed.</i> The fourth generation was defined by the invention of the microprocessor, which placed an entire central processing unit on a single chip, leading to the personal computer revolution. The fifth generation, which continues today, focuses on artificial intelligence, parallel processing, and ultra-large-scale integration.</p>

        <h3>Mathematics in Computing</h3>
        <p>Mathematics provides <mark><small> the foundational logic and structures for computing, from binary arithmetic to complex algorithms</small></mark>.Discrete mathematics, including graph theory and combinatorics, is essential for data organization and network design. <b> Boolean algebra </b>forms the basis of digital circuit design and programming logic. <b>Statistics and probability</b> are crucial for <u>data science, machine learning, and algorithm analysis.</u> <em>Computational complexity theory uses mathematical analysis to evaluate the efficiency and limitations of algorithms.</em></p>

        <h3>Birth of the Internet</h3>
        <p>Born from Cold War tensions and the need for robust communication networks after the Soviet launch of Sputnik, the U.S. Department of Defense initiated research that led to the ARPANET. The first successful message on this precursor network was sent between computers at <b>UCLA</b> and Stanford Research Institute on <u>October 29, 1969</u>, though it crashed after transmitting just <mark><small>"LO"</small></mark>. Critical to the internet's expansion was the development of <strong>TCP/IP</strong> protocols by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn in the 1970s, which standardized communication between different networks. The internet we recognize today was officially born on <em>January 1, 198</em>3, when <i>ARPANET</i> adopted <b>TCP/IP</b>, creating a universal language for interconnected networks. This infrastructure was later revolutionized by <mark><small>Tim Berners-Lee's invention of the World Wide Web in <em>1989</em>, which introduced <b><u> HTML, HTTP, and URLs</u></b>, making the internet accessible to the public.</small></mark> </p>

        <h3>Modern Era</h3>
        <p>The Modern Era is broadly defined as the period following the Middle Ages, from approximately the 16 <sup>th </sup>century to the present day. <u>It is characterized by rapid industrialization, technological advancement, and the rise of the nation-state.</u> This period has seen profound social and political changes, including revolutions, the expansion of global trade, and the digital revolution. Philosophically, it is marked by a focus on individualism, reason, and scientific progress over tradition. <u>While it has brought unprecedented connectivity and development, it also faces criticisms for consumerism and environmental challenges</u>.</p>
